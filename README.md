## Ideas (TODO):

- Sentiment (emotion in text, energicity of text, ...)
- disinformation 
- sarcasm (hard)
- medicine?
- movies?
- text professionality 
- manipulation in text 
- shortness/brevity of text 
- financial markers 
- marketing: is product represented on market?
- cv parsing (with genetic alg and fl) 

- market analysis (i.e. dollar / crypto value based on news)
- air attack prognosis (based on tg chanels / radio)
- fuzzy timeseries prognosis (may be + genetic algrthms)
- RAG system (Nastya)

- text summarizing (may be local news, etc.) (Dmitro)
- Also: web parsing, + web app for text summarization
